## ðŸ§© Personal Note

In the **[Sample for Learning](./Sample for learning/)**, you can see **my first acquaintance with Active Learning** â€” a simple hands-on implementation that helped me understand how models can actively choose the most informative data points to learn from.  
It was both exciting and insightful to see how much performance improvement can come from *asking the right questions* instead of labeling everything!

In the **[First Project](./first project/)**, you can see a **test using a well-known dataset**, which demonstrates how Active Learning performs in a more practical, data-driven scenario.

| Folder | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| [`Sample for Learning/`](./sample for Learning/) | Contains the initial experiment showing my first steps with Active Learning â€” including uncertainty sampling and iterative model updates. |
| [`First Project/`](./First Project/) | Includes tests and evaluations on a well-known dataset to analyze Active Learning performance in a realistic setting. |
